## SARS-CoV-2 analysis with Puerto Rico-focused subsampling
This analysis focuses on SARS-CoV-2 sequences available from Puerto Rico with additional sequences from 
the rest of the USA selected based upon genetic similarity. Additional global context is provided by evenly sampling sequences from 
major global regions.

Input data sets are weighted towards sequences collected within the last two months.
