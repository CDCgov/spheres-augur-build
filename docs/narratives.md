Nextstrain Narratives allow you to pair a specific view of a dataset with text and images to generate scrollable, interactive reports.

For examples, [see our weekly Situation Reports](https://nextstrain.org/ncov-sit-reps) from the first several months of the pandemic.

You can [read more about Narratives here](https://nextstrain.org/docs/narratives/introduction).
We've also [provided a template narrative file](https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov/tree/master/narratives/template_narrative.md) for you to edit.  
You can preview the template narrative by navigating to [https://nextstrain.org/community/narratives/nextstrain/ncov/template_narrative](https://nextstrain.org/community/narratives/nextstrain/ncov/template_narrative).

We'll add more to this page soon; in the meantime, if you get stuck, don't hesitate to [ask for help](README.md#Help)! :)
