# SPHERES augur build

## Overview

This repository analyzes viral genomes using [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org) to understand how SARS-CoV-2, the virus that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, evolves and spreads.
This is a copy of [the original Nextstrain ncov repository](https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov/).

## Usage

Clone this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CDCgov/spheres-augur-build.git
cd spheres-augur-build/
```

Modify build definitions, as needed, in `spheres_profile/builds.yaml`.
For more details about modifying builds, [see the SPHERES profile README](spheres_profile/README.md).
Run the workflow.

```bash
snakemake --profile spheres_profile/
```

View the resulting builds with auspice from a local machine.

```bash
auspice view
```

## Workflow Maintenance

The Nextstrain team constantly updates the ncov workflow by curating the input data and improving the workflow itself.
To benefit from these upstream changes, this repository can track the original Nextstrain ncov repository as an upstream remote.

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov.git
```

Download the latest from the Nextstrain ncov repository.

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

Merge these changes into the local repository, adding an explicit merge commit.

```bash
git merge --no-ff upstream/master
```

Resolve any conflicts that occur and re-run the workflow, to benefit from the latest changes in the upstream.
